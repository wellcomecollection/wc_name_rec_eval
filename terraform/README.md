# Terraform DNS Infrastructure

This directory contains Terraform configuration that manages **only RouteÂ 53 DNS records** required for email authentication and custom MAIL FROM support for the `wellcomecollection.org` domain in the context of this AWS Amplify project.

## Scope

Managed via Terraform here:

* Hosted zone lookup (data source) for `wellcomecollection.org`.
* Three Amazon SES DKIM selector CNAME records.
* A DMARC monitoring TXT record (`_dmarc.wellcomecollection.org`) with a `p=none` policy (no enforcement; enables future reporting if rua/ruf tags are added later).
* Custom MAIL FROM domain records for SES in `eu-west-2`:
  * MX record pointing at `feedback-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonses.com`.
  * SPF (TXT) record: `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all` (scoped to the MAIL FROM subdomain, separate from the apex SPF already present outside this config).

## Out of Scope

All application hosting, APIs, storage, and related infrastructure are provisioned by **AWS Amplify** (see project root / Amplify configuration). This Terraform module intentionally avoids overlapping with Amplify-managed resources.

## Apply Workflow

1. Ensure AWS credentials/assume role permitting Route 53 changes (role specified in `terraform.tf`).
2. Run `terraform init` (first time or after provider changes).
3. Run `terraform plan` to review proposed DNS record creations.
4. Run `terraform apply` to create the records.

## Verification (Post-Apply)

Example dig checks (optional):

```bash
dig +short CNAME g6j34hsjpzr3g5gylbmsaab7nr4zoedq._domainkey.wellcomecollection.org
dig +short TXT _dmarc.wellcomecollection.org
dig +short MX  ses-eu-west-2.wellcomecollection.org
dig +short TXT ses-eu-west-2.wellcomecollection.org
```

## SSL on Custom Domain

Note that `narese.wellcomecollection.org` CNAME entry points to a Cloudfront distribution created by Amplify when setting up SSL for the custom domain.

If we want to retry the set up of the above on Amplify, ensure that the CNAME record is deleted first or Amplify will throw an error.

On each retry, Amplify creates a new Cloudfront distribution which requires a new CNAME record to be created.
